## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use an image within a div. I also formed the habit of putting my margins on only one side of each element so that I don't have to think of the sum of margins/paddings from different elements.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to make responsive cards using flexbox only and no media queries. In general I want to improve how my cards adapt to different screen sizes. 

I also want to better understand how to use background images and color gradient overlays.
